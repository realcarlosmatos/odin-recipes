    <h2>Alongside the <a href="bread.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bread</a> and <a href="pizza.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pizza</a> recipes, it’s pretty obvious that my goal here is to make your heart skip a beat. Not because of all the salt, sugar, and fat, mind you, but because everything is so delicious. What? Did you think otherwise? What do you take me for?</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients — <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/french-fries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg Maris Piper or King Edward potatoes</li>
        <li>vegetable oil, for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps — <a href="https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/french-fries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source</a></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut into 1cm-thick batons. Put into a bowl of cold water and leave to soak for at least 2 hrs to remove the starch from the potatoes – this will help them crisp while frying.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes well and pat dry with kitchen paper. Fill a deep pan no more than a third full with oil and heat to 140C, or until a cube of bread dropped in browns in 60 seconds. Fry the French fries in batches for 6 mins per batch until golden straw-coloured, cooked through and lightly crisp. Drain well on kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat up until the oil reaches 180C, or a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds. Fry the French fries again for 2-3 mins per batch until lightly golden and really crisp. Drain on kitchen paper and immediately season with sea salt.</li>
    </ol>
